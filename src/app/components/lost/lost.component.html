    <h2>Have you Lost your Pet?</h2>

    <p>
        Visit Austin Animal Center to look for your lost pet as soon as possible.
        All types of domestic and unique pets, exotic animals, farm animals and 
        wildlife may be brought to the center. Due to the large number of animals,
        some may be held for only three days or less after intake.
        Please visit the shelter every day and search our <a routerLink="/animals" routerLinkActive="active" >database</a>
        to check for your lost pet.
